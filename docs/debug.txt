## FIXED: Companies Not Loading After Login (2025-10-30)

### Problem
User itgroup.luck@gmail.com logged in successfully but company list was not loaded.
Browser console showed: "[CompanyProvider] No session token, skipping company load"

### Root Cause
The CompanyProvider only loaded companies once on mount. It didn't react to authentication state changes.
When a user logged in, the sessionToken was set, but CompanyProvider's initial useEffect had already run.

### Solution
Modified /Users/work/apps/ankey/src/lib/company-context.tsx:
1. Added import: useAuthStore from auth.store
2. Added isAuthenticated state from useAuthStore
3. Updated useEffect to watch isAuthenticated state
4. Now companies automatically reload when user logs in
5. Companies automatically clear when user logs out

### Changes Made
- File: src/lib/company-context.tsx
  - Line 4: Added useAuthStore import
  - Line 28: Added isAuthenticated selector
  - Line 160-170: Updated useEffect to depend on isAuthenticated

### Result
✓ TypeScript compilation successful (no errors)
✓ Companies will now load automatically after successful login
✓ Dashboard will show company list immediately after authentication
